Needed my iOS to match my Android app for bordered fonts.  Extends TextView functions as well as secondary variables to override super.onDraw(Canvas) calls in order to apply text border/text drawText() calls.
- Default mode is Helvetica-Nueve font, but other should work with an imported .ttf Typefaces.
- Allows setting of border/text color
- Allows text alignments/margins
- Should work functionally with all superclass functions of Textview
